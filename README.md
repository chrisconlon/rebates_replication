## Organization of files

We organize the files in the replication package into two parts:
1. Part 1 does the descriptive analysis (in Python)
2. Part 2 does the numerical simulation model (in Matlab)

Each part lives in a separate folder. Within each folder we separate files as

PartX
./code : where the code lives and is run from
./raw_data : inputs we provide as part of the replication package / or can provide upon request
./proc_data : intermediate data generated by our package (these should initially be empty)
./figures: figures produced by our code
./tables: tables produced by our code


## Requirements

The following packages/dependencies are required to run the replication package
1. Python 3.7 or higher (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, pyarrow)
2. MATLAB (tested on R2020a): slmengine (SLM Toolbox)

The python packages (appropriate versions) can be install via pip with 

```pip install -r requirements.txt ```


## List of Tables
We list each table and the code that produces it

- Table 1 (table1_summary.tex): 2_descriptives_summaries.py
- Table 2 (table2_threshold.tex): 2_descriptives_summaries.py
- Table 3 (table3_ols.tex): 2_descriptives_summaries.py
- Table 4 (.tex):  .py
- Table 5 (.tex): .py
